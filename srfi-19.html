    <h1>SRFI 19: Time Data Types and Procedures</h1>
    <p>
      This is a Chibi Scheme port of
      the <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-19/srfi-19.scm">Standard Implementation</a>
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-19/srfi-19.html">SRFI 19</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bulk of the code is from the standard implementation, with only a few tweaks to
      make it work under Chibi Scheme. The test suite has been expanded so that each exported
      function is exercised at least once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full source of this version is available
      on <a href="https://github.com/OpinionatedGeek/SRFI19">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many thanks to Will Fitzgerald and the SRFI Editors for providing the SRFI and the standard
      implementation code.
